I created a To-Do List Web App using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for functionality. Every time you enter a task, it's stored in an array for that session until the page is refreshed. While in the session, that and every other task is displayed in a list viewable on the webpage. With each task, there's a delete button allowing you to delete said task, clearing the array storing the tasks, and repopulating it with the tasks besides the removed one.
